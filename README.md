# Mixed Reality Escape Room

A sophisticated mixed reality escape room system combining Unity frontend with Python backend processing. The project features real-time performance monitoring, adaptive quality management, and procedural content generation.

## What This Code Does

This is a **Mixed Reality Escape Room** system that creates immersive, procedurally generated escape room experiences. The Unity frontend handles real-time rendering, user interaction, and performance monitoring, while Python backends manage physics simulation, computer vision, narrative generation, and world building.

**Key Features:**
- **Real-time Performance Monitoring**: Tracks FPS, memory usage, CPU/GPU performance across Unity and Python systems
- **Adaptive Quality Management**: Automatically adjusts graphics quality based on performance metrics
- **Procedural Generation**: Creates infinite cave environments, puzzles, and narratives using algorithmic generation
- **Mixed Reality Integration**: Manages occlusion, boundaries, and depth perception for VR/AR experiences
- **Cross-platform Optimization**: Unity-Python bridge for seamless performance data sharing and optimization

**Architecture:**
- **Unity (C#)**: Game logic, rendering, user interface, performance monitoring
- **Python Backend**: Physics engine, vision processing, narrative generation, world building
- **Communication**: WebSocket integration for real-time data exchange between systems

The system automatically generates unique escape room experiences with intelligent difficulty scaling, ensuring optimal performance across different hardware configurations while maintaining immersive gameplay.
